# Dashboard Redesign — Progress Tracker

Single source of truth for the dashboard-redesign effort so no step is skipped or
repeated across sessions. Update the checkboxes as PRs merge.

## Done (merged to `main`)

- [x] **PR-A (#49)** — Design-token foundation + self-hosted fonts. Fixed the
      unloaded-font defect; introduced the indigo `#635BFF` `--sa-*` token system;
      bundled Inter + IBM Plex Sans Arabic (no Google Fonts CDN).
- [x] **PR-B (#50)** — Dashboard visual restyle onto the tokens to match the
      approved Claude Design: KPI cards, quick actions, recent activity, insight /
      tip, empty state, responsive + Arabic RTL, dependency-free SVG `AreaChart`.
      Chart / by-status / trend chips render honest **"coming soon" placeholders**
      (no fabricated data); the **"This month" filter deliberately omitted**;
      sidebar restyle deferred.
- [x] **Copy fix (#51)** — Removed all em/en dashes from user-facing copy
      app-wide + a no-em-dash guard test covering **all** i18n keys × 3 locales.

## In progress / remaining (dashboard redesign)

- [x] **PR-C1 (#52)** — Backend analytics. Extended `GET /documents/stats`
      additively with `statusBreakdown`, `monthlySeries`, and `periods`; Prisma
      aggregations (org-scoped); additive index migration; backend tests. Real
      statuses (Processed / Needs review / Rejected); approval-rate omitted; UTC
      month boundaries for v1. Backend only — no frontend render change.
- [x] **PR-C2 (this PR)** — Frontend wiring. Feeds real series / breakdown /
      trend-chip from PR-C1's payload; restores the **"This month" / "All time"**
      control (scoped to the Processed KPI — the only metric with real period
      data); chart RTL (series reversed, months right-to-left, highlight
      mirrored via a minimal `rtl` prop on AreaChart). Strict no-fabrication:
      each widget shows the calm placeholder when its data is genuinely empty
      (chart also when `totalCount === 0` or the series sums to 0); zero-base
      trend shows a "New" badge, never `+100%`/`∞`. Pure helpers in
      `lib/dashboardAnalytics.ts` unit-tested; component + RTL tests added.

**The core dashboard redesign (PR-A → PR-C2) is now complete.**

## Phase D — design-system propagation

The dashboard is the reference; Phase D carries the indigo `--sa-*` system to
every other screen. **D1 is the high-leverage multiplier** (chrome + a token
bridge), after which each remaining PR is a focused per-screen restyle.

- [x] **PR-D1 (this PR)** — **Chrome + legacy-var/class token bridge.** Retargets
      the legacy CSS vars (`--accent`, `--card`, `--border`, `--nav-active-*`, …)
      to alias the `--sa-*` tokens (light + dark, single source of truth), so the
      shared component classes (`.saas-card`, `.btn-primary`, `.nav-item`,
      `.saas-table`, `.badge-*`, `.skeleton`) instantly reskin onto indigo with
      token radii + quiet elevation. Restyles the chrome (`Layout`, `Sidebar`,
      `BottomTabBar`) onto tokens and converts its physical CSS to logical
      properties (`ms`/`me`, `start`/`end`, `border-e`, `text-start`) so the rail
      and bottom tab bar mirror correctly in Arabic/RTL. **No anti-steering /
      `isNativePlatform` / pricing change; Sidebar plan area stays status-only.**
      Consequence (intended): every other screen is now recolored onto indigo and
      picks up the restyled shared cards/buttons/tables. Screens that still carry
      raw `blue-*` utilities in their bodies render **two-tone** (indigo chrome +
      blue screen-body accents) until their own D-PR lands — reskinned, not broken.
- [x] **PR-D2** — **Search screen restyle.** Restyled `SearchScreen` and its
      sub-components (`AnswerCard`, `ResultTable`, `ClarificationCard`,
      `ChartPlaceholder`, `ReportCard`, plus the shared `ErrorState` /
      `EmptyState`) onto the `--sa-*` tokens across every state: idle + insights
      gallery, loading skeleton, answer card, data table (clickable rows →
      `/documents/:id`, read-only), bar chart, clarification (amber), empty-data,
      and error (red). Fixes from the read-only audit: (1) **RTL** — all physical
      offsets/padding/borders converted to logical (`ps`/`pe`, `start`/`end`,
      `border-s`, `text-start`, `rounded-e`, `rtl:-scale-x-100`) so Arabic
      mirrors; numerals kept LTR. (2) **Hero H1 i18n bug** — dropped the
      `split('data')` highlight trick that appended a literal English "data" to
      the FR/AR strings; the translated headline now renders cleanly. (3) **i18n
      the hardcoded English labels** — AnswerCard / ClarificationCard /
      ChartPlaceholder / ResultTable-empty / ErrorState defaults + the two search
      error sentences are now real keys in en/fr/ar (MSA). No-em-dash guard
      extended to name the new keys. **No fabricated data** (answer renders only
      the backend result; no invented comparisons). **No anti-steering / pricing
      / `isNativePlatform` change** (Search has none; PR #47 stays green). Dead
      code removed: `SearchScreen.loadReport` + `reportsService` + orphan
      `SearchBar.tsx`.
- [x] **PR-D3** — **File Detail restyle.** Restyled `DocumentDetailScreen`
      (route `/documents/:id`) and its shared sub-components (`DecisionBanner`,
      `FixActionPanel`, `ReviewBadge`) onto the `--sa-*` tokens: retired the
      oversized mega-card / heavy shadow for the calm flat surface, sentence
      case, Lucide icons, small colored status dots, no emoji. (1) **Status
      reconciliation** — the meta-grid status now routes through the same shared
      config as the Search card (`getStatus` / `statusProcessed`), so it reads
      Processed / Needs review / Rejected with matching dots and Arabic
      (`تمت المعالجة`), never the raw enum; the rule-engine decision vocabulary
      (Approved / Needs review / Flagged) stays a distinct tinted banner. (2)
      **RTL** — per-value `dir`/`<bdi>` isolation on title, fact values,
      currency, entity chips, and confidence percent so Latin text + numerals
      do not scramble in Arabic. (3) **i18n** — every remaining hardcoded
      English string (toasts, preview fallback, decision Flagged/Approved copy,
      all FixActionPanel strings) moved to en/fr/ar keys; the shared queue
      toasts routed to the same keys. (4) **`$` → neutral MAD unit** on the
      correction input via a durable input-group that cannot overlap the typed
      value (any locale / font / zoom). Follow-up commit fixed the long-filename
      card overflow on mobile (`self-stretch`-bounded title + existing truncate)
      and hardened entity chips (`max-w` + truncate). All copy em-dash-free.
      **No anti-steering / pricing / `isNativePlatform` change** (detail has
      none; `nativeAntiSteering` stays green). **No fabricated data.**
- [ ] **PR-D4** — Review Queue restyle. **← next.** Screen body still on raw
      palette + `saas-table`; its shared components (`ReviewBadge` et al.) are
      already migrated by D3, so this is the screen shell + table/cards only.
- [ ] **PR-D5** — Activity restyle.
- [ ] **PR-D6** — Settings + Paywall restyle. ⚠️ **Sensitive:** touches paywall
      surfaces — must not alter anti-steering / `isNativePlatform` gating (PR #47).
- [ ] **PR-D7** — Auth screen restyle.
- [ ] **PR-D8** — Profile + modals (Upload / Capture / Delete-account) restyle.
- [ ] **PR-D9** — Legal screens (Terms / Privacy / Delete-account info) restyle.
- [ ] **Landing** — tracked separately from the app shell (marketing surface).

## Remaining (post-redesign, separate work)

- [ ] Per-period breakdown / pending / confidence (PR-C1 only provides
      per-period *processed* counts, so the "This month" control scopes only the
      Processed KPI today). Would need extra backend period aggregations.

## Known separate item (NOT part of the redesign)

- [ ] Three **developer-only** diagnostic strings still contain em dashes and are
      **not** user-facing (optional cleanup, own PR if desired):
      `PaywallModal.tsx:112` (console.error), `paddle.ts:8` (thrown Error),
      `apiConfig.ts:12` (console.error).

## Design decisions locked

- **Accent:** indigo `#635BFF` via the `--sa-*` tokens.
- **Fonts:** Inter (Latin) + IBM Plex Sans Arabic (Arabic), self-hosted.
- **Status breakdown:** REAL statuses only — COMPLETED→Processed,
  NEEDS_REVIEW→Needs review, REJECTED→Rejected. **No fabricated Approved/Flagged
  buckets.** FAILED / in-flight PROCESSING excluded from the breakdown.
- **No approval-rate metric** in the C-series.
- **Periods:** UTC month boundaries for v1 (no per-org timezone).
- **"Processed" definition:** COMPLETED + NEEDS_REVIEW (matches the existing
  `totalCount`), bucketed by `processedAt`.
- **No pricing / anti-steering UI on the dashboard, ever.** Native anti-steering
  gating (PR #47) stays untouched and green.
- **Honesty rule:** never render fabricated numbers — show the placeholder when
  data is genuinely empty.
